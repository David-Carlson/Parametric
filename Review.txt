The Ball bounce at the beginning is very satisfying
The speed of the ball can be a bit difficult to control
What separates this game from other dodge the enemies games?
Is it going to be a 2d or 3d game in the end.
3 unique types of movement blink, drop, and choose angle.

Jump should move set distance upwards instead of having to point it
(Unless I'm not understanding the instructions)
The concept is interesting. Look into The Impossible Game.
The camera should follow the ball.
You shouldn't implement enemy AI imo, it might make it too difficult.
Best of luck!
